# Next Word Prediction

This repository contains machine learning models and code for predicting the next word in a sequence based on a variety of algorithms and methods, such as TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity, AdaBoost, and more. The project demonstrates how to use different techniques for text prediction tasks.

## Features

- **Next Word Prediction using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity**
- **Next Word Prediction using AdaBoost**
- **Training and evaluating multiple models**
- **Interactive Web Application using Flask**
- **Support for different types of word embeddings and vectorizers**
