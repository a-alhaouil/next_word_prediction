This repository contains machine learning models and code for predicting the next word in a sequence based on a variety of algorithms and methods, such as TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity, AdaBoost, and more. The project demonstrates how to use different techniques for text prediction tasks.

## Features

- **Next Word Prediction using:**
-  **TF-IDF Multinominal Naive Bayes model / embedding with universal model encoder by Tensor Flow with  LSTM model**
- **Training and evaluating multiple models**
- **Interactive Web Application using Flask**
- **Support for different types of word embeddings and vectorizers**

## Requirements

Before running the code, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `Flask`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `keras`
- `tensorflow`
- `nltk`
- `gensim`

You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## additional step for universal model encoder from Tensor Flow :
make sure when you install it and make a rep in your repository named **universal_model_encoder_tf**
```bash
